Mario Macias Lloret wrote this file. Considering this, you can do what you
want with it: modify it, redistribute it, sell it, etc... But you will always
have to credit me as an author in the code.

In addition, if we meet someday and you think this code has been useful for
you, you MUST pay me a beer (a good one, if possible) as a reward for my
contribution.
